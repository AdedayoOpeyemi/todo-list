# Todo List

"To-do list" is a tool that helps to organize your day. It simply lists the things that you need to do and allows you to mark them as complete.

## Project specifications

### Project requirements
- Set up a new project with webpack that is based on the webpack exercise you have already completed.
- Create an **index.html** file and write your HTML markup here. Create an empty **To Do List** placeholder (`<div>` or `<ul>` element). The **index.html** file must be set as a template using the *HTML Webpack Plugin*.
- Create an **index.js** file and set an array of some simple *to do tasks* (array of objects). Each task object should contain three keys: 
  1. description [`string`].
  2. completed [`bool`].
  3. index: [`number`].
- Write a function to iterate over the tasks array and populate an HTML list item element for each task.
- On page load render the dynamically created list of tasks in the dedicated placeholder. The list should apear in order of the `index` values for each task.
- Create a **style.css** and set rules for the **To Do List**. CSS must be loaded by *Webpack Style/CSS Loader*. Your list should be a clone of the part of the minimalist project captured in the video below.
- All your source files (**index.html**, **index.js** and **style.css**) must be located in */src* directory and your distribution files will be generated by webpack and served by *webpack dev server* from */dist* folder.
need to use only one repository for your pair-programming group.
