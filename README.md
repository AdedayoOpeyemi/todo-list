# Todo List

"To-do list" is a tool that helps to organize your day. It simply lists the things that you need to do and allows you to mark them as complete.

## Live Demo

### Project requirements feature1 
- Set up a new project with webpack that is based on the webpack exercise you have already completed.
- Create an **index.html** file and write your HTML markup here. Create an empty **To Do List** placeholder (`<div>` or `<ul>` element). The **index.html** file must be set as a template using the *HTML Webpack Plugin*.
- Create an **index.js** file and set an array of some simple *to do tasks* (array of objects). Each task object should contain three keys: 
  1. description [`string`].
  2. completed [`bool`].
  3. index: [`number`].
- Write a function to iterate over the tasks array and populate an HTML list item element for each task.
- On page load render the dynamically created list of tasks in the dedicated placeholder. The list should apear in order of the `index` values for each task.
- Create a **style.css** and set rules for the **To Do List**. CSS must be loaded by *Webpack Style/CSS Loader*. Your list should be a clone of the part of the minimalist project captured in the video below.
- All your source files (**index.html**, **index.js** and **style.css**) must be located in */src* directory and your distribution files will be generated by webpack and served by *webpack dev server* from */dist* folder.
need to use only one repository for your pair-programming group.

### Project requirements feature2
- Add a new JavaScript files and import it as a module:
- it will contain methods related to the status updates (completed: true / false).
- Add event listener to the checkbox (change).
- Update items object's value for completed key upon user actions.
- Store the updated array of items in local storage, so the user gets the correct list values after the page reloads.

### Milestone 3 Project requirements
- Remove all hardcoded items from the tasks array.
- Create a new JavaScript file for the new functionality.
- Implement a function for adding a new task (add a new element to the array).
- Implement a function for editing task descriptions.
- Implement a function for deleting a task (remove an element from the array).
- Implement a function for the "Clear all completed" button (use filter() method).
- By default new tasks should have the property completed set to false and the property index set to the value of the new array length (i.e. if you're adding a 5th task to the list, the index of that task should equal to 5).
- Deleting a task should update all remaining items' indexes, so they represent the current list order and are unique.
- All changes to the To Do List should be saved in local storage.
